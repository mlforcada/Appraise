# Document-level gisting

This directory of this fork of Appraise contains code that has been used in a series of machine
translation evaluation experiments via gap-filling.

Directory **pre** contains a set of scripts used to prepare sets of gap-filling jobs to be manually downloaded into Appraise.

Directory **post** contains a set of scripts used to manage manually-downloaded result files, once the gap-filling experiments are complete.
